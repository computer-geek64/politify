# Politify

### A tool for helping people understand where celebrities and politicians fall on the political spectrum.

Made by: Ashish D'Souza and Sharath Palathingal

### What we used to implement Politify:

* **ReactJS** for UI/UX
* **Flask** as our back-end application framework
* **PostgreSQL** for database storage
* **Google Cloud**
  * **Natural Language API** for performing sentiment analysis on tweets
  * Also used for preprocessing the tweet datasets with text classification (unsupervised learning)
* **Pandas** for preprocessing datasets
* **Transformers** for implementing the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (**BERT**) natural language processing networks
* **PyTorch** for training and testing the machine learning models
* **Nvidia CUDA** for GPU-accelerated computations to faster optimize the machine learning models, running on an Nvidia RTX 2070 Super graphics card
